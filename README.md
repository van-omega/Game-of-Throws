# Game-of-Throws
A game made in Java using SWING paint component. Physics projectile motion was implemented using threads. [No Game Engine was used on creating this app, and was made prior my IT industry experience so this is subject to refactoring].

# Note: Projectile Motion was implemented inside a thread using the original Physics formula (Pixels where used instead of meters)
